    "HISTORY": "Peace Christian International Ministry was started back in 2005 with Lucas Odeny and Lawrence Olum. Having difficulty in organizing the church structures and leadership, they later handed the church to Pastor Erick Owino in 2007. Having the vision to help his community out, he tirelessly struggled with the community members to make the church have an official registration with the government. Following the vision the pastor had, he together with church members successfully started a childrenâ€™s home/orphanage in which members contributed immensely. On September 12, 2012, they officially registered the church after successfully conforming to the rules and regulations of the Societies Act. Until then, the church has been successful with its leader Erick Owino as the presiding Archbishop and Joanes Dudu as the Bishop.",
