Started in 2007 at a small village in Siaya County, GemWagai Sub-County, South Gem ward, Kasiwa village. After a vision evangelist Erick Owino had, he saw it important to help the needy children by then affected with the HIV/AIDS, which by then claimed the life of so many parents and also children who succumbed to it, were a major concern on the coming generation. Home of Peace has been implementing holistic community-based OVC support and development interventions in Gem Sub County, Siaya County in Kenya. The program is striving to address the diverse needs of orphan and vulnerable children and youths in line with its strategic objective of reducing their vulnerability to social, economic and psychological problems. Home of Peace is engaged in community-based social & economic support interventions, community awareness raising to reduce vulnerability of children, and facilitation of quality social services to OVCs and youths who are most at risk.","WHY_ARE_THESE_CHILDREN_AT_THE_HOME":["As a registered Children\u2019s Home, the children are placed with us by the Department of Children\u2019s Services and their placement is kept under review by the court.","We could tell endless stories about our children. But we do not want to identify individual children out of respect for their right to privacy. They come from some really sad backgrounds.","Some have parents who died as a result of AIDS, Typhoid, Malaria or other diseases and as a result, they were left homeless and had to fend for themselves because their home village was too poor to take on an extra hungry child.","Some were taken by their family from their tiny villages in the bush and dumped in the town of Siaya because the family could no longer look after them.","We are talking about children as young as 3 or 4 years old. Once in Siaya they were simply left and had to beg or steal to survive.","We want to focus on the positive!","These children now have a home.","They have medical care.","They have clothing.","They go to school.","They are loved and looked after.","We will not identify what happened to any particular child before they came to Home of Peace. They are not exhibits in a zoo. They are children and entitled to their privacy.","We believe that many will grow up to become significant adult members of society: community leaders, doctors, nurses, pastors, etc. It would be wrong for their past to be waiting online to be held in their faces later in life.","So, we hope you will all understand why we tend to be very private about the backgrounds of our children."]}')},function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"ACADEMY_NAME":"PEACE ELITE JUNIOR ACADEMY","ADDRESS":"13 AKALA","SCHOOL_MOTTO":"Ever the best","SCHOOL_VISION":"To enable learners to rise and shine within the community","SCHOOL_MISSION":"To enable learners to expand their potential and to prepare them to become productive, responsible and compassionate members of society.","EXTRA_PROGRAMS":[{"PROGRAM_NAME":"Feeding program","PROGRAM_DESCRIPTION":"To enable the less fortunate learners get something to cushion them while learning"}],"WHY_FEEDING_PROGRAM":"With the current situation of tough economic times, providing meals is a problem and it\u2019s a challenge for children to walk for long distances in order to get education.

Having difficulty in organizing the church structures and leadership, they later handed the church to Pastor Erick Owino in 2007. Having the vision to help his community out, he tirelessly struggled with the community members to make the church have an official registration with the government. Following the vision the pastor had, he together with church members successfully started a children\u2019s home/orphanage in which members contributed immensely. On September 12, 2012, they officially registered the church after successfully conforming to the rules and regulations of the Societies Act. Until then, the church has been successful with its leader Erick Owino as the presiding Archbishop and Joanes Dudu as the Bishop.","MISSION_STATEMENT":"To build capacity of organization by networking with community programs and training church leaders.
