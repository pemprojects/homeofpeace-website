This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)

A pre-deploy job is an optional task that runs after each build, but before all your services are deployed. It is commonly used for preliminary tasks which are required for your services to run, such as a database migration or seeding. Note: any commands that are used to build your application should not be included in a pre-deploy job, as the build will already be completed by the time the pre-deploy job is run.
